		<p id="about-me-text" class="hidden">Hello! My name is Kayla Beyerlein, and I am a dedicated Technical Support Specialist with over 7 years of experience troubleshooting phones, tablets, computers, routers, and IoT devices at T-Mobile.
			<br>
			I hold a Bachelor's degree from CTU, which has equipped me with the skills needed for full-stack development. I am proficient in various scripting languages. Since graduating, I have continued my education by pursuing certifications. I currently hold a Microsoft IT Certificate and am in the process of obtaining an AWS Certificate.
			<br>
			Outside of work, I am passionate about learning new things and am a quick study. I enjoy reading, gardening, and spending time with animals. 
			
			Feel free to reach out to me using the Contact page. I am open to freelance work and collaborating on projects.</p>
		<p id="my-experiences-text" class="hidden">I have been working for T-Mobile since January 2018. Initially, I served as an Account Expert until mid-2021, where I assisted customers with billing inquiries and provided basic troubleshooting. I was then promoted to the Technical Support team, where I have been resolving complex technical issues, collaborating with engineering teams, and improving customer satisfaction.
			<br>
			During this period, I also earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering. I am currently continuing my education through various certifications.
			<br>
			Prior to this, I worked as a Department Manager at Walmart from 2012 to 2017, managing the Shoes, Jewelry, and Accessories departments. During this time, I also completed an Apprentice Electrician course through IEC Chesapeake, where I learned about commercial and residential wiring.</p>
